# Mathcad2LaTeX

Mathcad2LaTeX is an AutoHotkey script which converts math expressions copied from Mathcad Prime into a format usable in LaTeX's equation environment.

## Background

I wrote the script near the end of 2018 during the final stages of a mechanical engineering group project to speed up report writing. At the time, my programming experience was limited to an introductionary mechatronics course using Assembly and the occasional hotkey implementation in AutoHotkey. Additionally, I only set aside a few days for development, and the code quality suffers as a result - loops implemented with goto and labels being the most glaring example. I like to think I've learned a lot since, and this project is intended to reimagine the original script with better coding practices and a more modular design.
